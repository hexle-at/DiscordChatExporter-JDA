# DiscordChatExporter-JDA

**Project status:** ``âœ… Active`` ([More information...](https://github.com/hexle-at/project-info/blob/main/docs/status.md))

This standalone java class can export any textchannel from discord, as long as your bot has enough permission!

Demo: https://hexle.at/api/discord_chat_exporter/demoExport.html
<br>

Exports **1.000 messages** in a channel in less than **10 seconds**! (If there is a bad internet connection / CPU it might take some seconds longer!)<br>
-> We have exported 3.000 messages in 29.78 seconds!<br>
How to calculate the export time: **MESSAGE_AMOUNT/100 = SECONDS**<br>
